# Code Signing Setup Instructions

This document provides step-by-step instructions for setting up code signing for the Augment Telemetry Cleaner application.

## GitHub Secrets Configuration

To enable code signing, you need to configure the following GitHub Secrets in your repository settings:

### Windows Code Signing Secrets

1. **WINDOWS_CERTIFICATE_BASE64**
   - Your code signing certificate (.p12 file) encoded in base64
   - To generate: `base64 -i your-certificate.p12 -o certificate.txt`
   - Copy the contents of certificate.txt

2. **WINDOWS_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD**
   - The password for your .p12 certificate file

3. **WINDOWS_CERTIFICATE_NAME**
   - The subject name of your certificate (e.g., "Your Company Name")

### macOS Code Signing Secrets

1. **MACOS_CERTIFICATE_BASE64**
   - Your Developer ID Application certificate (.p12 file) encoded in base64
   - Export from Keychain Access and encode with base64

2. **MACOS_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD**
   - The password for your macOS .p12 certificate file

3. **MACOS_KEYCHAIN_PASSWORD**
   - A temporary password for the build keychain (can be any secure string)

4. **APPLE_ID**
   - Your Apple ID email address

5. **APPLE_ID_PASSWORD**
   - App-specific password for your Apple ID
   - Generate at: https://appleid.apple.com/account/manage

6. **APPLE_TEAM_ID**
   - Your Apple Developer Team ID (found in Apple Developer portal)

## Setting Up GitHub Secrets

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click on "Settings" tab
3. In the left sidebar, click "Secrets and variables" â†’ "Actions"
4. Click "New repository secret"
5. Add each secret with the exact name and value

## Certificate Requirements

### Windows Certificate
- **Type**: Code Signing Certificate
- **Recommended**: Extended Validation (EV) certificate for best SmartScreen reputation
- **Providers**: DigiCert, Sectigo, GlobalSign, etc.
- **Cost**: $100-500/year depending on type and provider

### macOS Certificate
- **Type**: Developer ID Application certificate
- **Requirement**: Apple Developer Program membership ($99/year)
- **Steps**:
  1. Join Apple Developer Program
  2. Create Developer ID Application certificate in Apple Developer portal
  3. Download and install in Keychain Access
  4. Export as .p12 file

## Testing Code Signing

### Without Certificates (Development)
The build will work without certificates but binaries won't be signed:
- Windows: Will show "Unknown publisher" warnings
- macOS: Will show Gatekeeper warnings

### With Certificates (Production)
- Windows: Reduced SmartScreen warnings (reputation builds over time)
- macOS: No Gatekeeper warnings after notarization

## Troubleshooting

### Windows Issues
- **SignTool not found**: Install Windows SDK
- **Certificate import fails**: Check password and certificate format
- **Signing fails**: Verify certificate is valid and not expired

### macOS Issues
- **Certificate not found**: Ensure Developer ID Application certificate is used
- **Notarization fails**: Check Apple ID credentials and team ID
- **Keychain issues**: Verify keychain password and permissions

### GitHub Actions Issues
- **Secret not found**: Verify secret names match exactly
- **Base64 decode fails**: Ensure certificate is properly encoded
- **Permission denied**: Check script permissions and paths

## Security Best Practices

1. **Protect Certificates**: Never commit certificates to version control
2. **Use Strong Passwords**: Use complex passwords for certificate files
3. **Rotate Secrets**: Regularly update app-specific passwords
4. **Monitor Usage**: Review GitHub Actions logs for signing attempts
5. **Backup Certificates**: Keep secure backups of certificate files

## Cost-Benefit Analysis

### With Code Signing
- **Pros**: Professional appearance, reduced security warnings, user trust
- **Cons**: Annual certificate costs, setup complexity

### Without Code Signing
- **Pros**: No additional costs, simpler setup
- **Cons**: Security warnings, reduced user trust, potential antivirus flags

## Recommended Approach

1. **Start without signing**: Get the application working first
2. **Add Windows signing**: Most users are on Windows, biggest impact
3. **Add macOS signing**: If you have significant macOS users
4. **Monitor feedback**: See if users report security warnings

## Support

If you encounter issues with code signing setup:
1. Check the GitHub Actions logs for detailed error messages
2. Verify all secrets are set correctly
3. Test certificate validity locally before using in CI/CD
4. Consult certificate provider documentation for specific requirements
